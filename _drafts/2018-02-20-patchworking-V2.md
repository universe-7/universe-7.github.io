Oh man - I must've had a lot of nervous excitement about diving into the Scuttleverse to apologize before even saying anything :D And probably some pent-up frustrations with the dominant social medias. 

The nice thing about the un-apologetic side of the spectrum is that people wake up, have to think, and remember.

So! Your question really got me thinking. I'd definitely been disenchanted with working in advertising before going out to Standing Rock. There was this knee-jerk reaction of wanting to walk away from it all after feeling the culture shock of returning to the NY ad world. 

There's concrete things that come to mind. Helped organize and fund a talk about experiences at Standing Rock in the city - hoping to build some bridges between what felt like two different countries. That in turn led to me opening up my live/work studio to host various activists and a Native American father-daughter family for a productive two month stretch.

Beyond the concrete, though - a big thing was taking this one large impulse to reject a capitalist way of life and breaking it down into more practical, actionable pieces. _Decentralizing_ the impulse if you will, HA (made myself cringe writing that). If I simply walk away, does that just feed an _us vs. them_ mentality, does that motivate those I know to change or think about their lives? 

Having a consciousness in mind, but keeping it on a personal level - seemed like my most effective way of continuing to build those bridges. Tuning myself to the moves required in larger chess game - whether its against advertising or tech monopolies - and making those moves in day-by-day steps. I find habits to be pretty powerful.

Pardon the long one here; I do really appreciate the chance to think about these things.

@marina thank you! I started photographing birds in earnest last spring, 2017. After doing photography as a student, artist, and professional for nearly 16 years - thankful to find a subject that makes me have to re-learn everything I thought I knew. 

@iBob so this is an American Kestrel - a male I've been 'following' since Nov 2017 at a quiet local nature center in Brooklyn. Smallest of the raptors - comparable in size to say, an overfed city pigeon. The beauty of their flight has been observed since archaic times when they were called [windfuckers](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/windfucker). I'd even venture that their European cousins were the basis for the ancient Egyptian falcon diety [Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus). He was pretty active that day - randomly warm day late January - catching grasshoppers all across the field. 

Definitely agree that a bit of disagreement can be a great thing. Maybe not as an end in itself, but to clarify a mindset, see a new position, stress-test an idea. I don't know if this is a saying but  '_Where there's heat, there might just be light..._' comes to mind. :)
