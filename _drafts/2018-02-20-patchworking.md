Hi @mozz and welcome.

Beautiful bird: please tell us about them and you?

As for toe trampling: while not actively advocating it, I'm starting to think a certain amount is both a healthy sign, and a desirable stimulant to thought and growth...)

Hi @mozz, incredible photo! welcome  :smiley:

I am intrigued by your pre-emptive apology! I see myself as being too far down the scale of un-apologetic, so perhaps I can learn something from you.

Can you tell us more about what happened to your life choices after North Dakota?

#### @Richard D. Bartlett

Oh man - I must've had a lot of nervous excitement about diving into the Scuttleverse to apologize before even saying anything :D And probably some pent-up frustrations with the dominant social medias. 

The nice thing about the un-apologetic side of the spectrum is that people wake up, have to think, and remember.

So! Your question really got me thinking. I'd definitely been disenchanted with working in advertising before going out to Standing Rock. There was this knee-jerk reaction of wanting to walk away from it all after feeling the culture shock of returning to the NY ad world. 

There's concrete things that come to mind. Helped organize and fund a talk about experiences at Standing Rock in the city - hoping to build some bridges between what felt like two different countries. That in turn led to me opening up my live/work studio to host various activists and a Native American father-daughter family for a productive two month stretch.

Beyond the concrete, though - a bit thing was taking this one large impulse to reject a capitalist way of life and breaking it down into more practical, actionable pieces. _Decentralizing_ the impulse if you will, HA (made myself cringe writing that). If I simply walk away, does that just feed an _us vs. them_ mentality, does that motivate those I know to change or think about their lives? 

Having a consciousness in mind, but keeping it on a personal level - seemed like my most effective way of continuing to build those bridges. Tuning myself to the moves required in larger chess game - whether its against advertising or tech monopolies - and making those moves in day-by-day steps. I find habits to be pretty powerful.

Pardon the long one here; I do really appreciate the chance to think about these things.

Your question really got me thinking - if only a tidy narrative fit the situation. I'd definitely been disenchanted with working in advertising before going out to Standing Rock. Beyond what I need for myself and to help my parents, it just seemed like the money wasn't worth creating things to feed an attention economy I didn't (and still don't) believe in. 

Had a knee-jerk reaction to simply walk away from it all after feeling the culture shock of the NYC ad world from a community of sharing and survival in North Dakota. Instead, I helped organize a talk at Hunter College and flew out Raymond Kingfisher, a Northern Cheyenne elder and lifetime activist.  So suddenly there is a guy who sang happy birthday to Rosa Parks, and he's sharing my futon mattress with 3 other activists while I'm sleeping under my desk and my cat is confused about all the company. 

Before I know it, 2 months pass and I'm saying goodbye to Nathan and Alethia - Omaha tribe father & daughter family who took over the futon after Raymond went back west to hold a sweat lodge. 

Still not sure I have the words here...but I do know they were able to
 - organize bank divestment actions
 - hold pipe ceremonies at the UN 
 - give afternoon talks at the American Indian Community House downtown
 - speak at the climate march in DC




### @marina @iBob

@marina thank you! I started photographing birds in earnest last spring, 2017. After doing photography as a student, artist, and professional for nearly 16 years - thankful to find a subject that makes me have to re-learn everything I thought I knew. 

@iBob so this is an American Kestrel - a male I've been 'following' since Nov 2017 at a quiet local nature center in Brooklyn. Smallest of the raptors - comparable in size to say, an overfed city pigeon. The beauty of their flight has been observed since archaic times when they were called [windfuckers](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/windfucker). I'd even venture that their European cousins were the basis for the ancient Egyptian falcon diety [Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus). 

Definitely agree that a bit of disagreement can be a great thing. Maybe not as an end in itself, but to clarify a mindset, see a new position, stress-test an idea. I don't know if this is a saying but  '_Where there's heat, there might just be light..._' comes to mind. :)

The talk seemed to come and go without leaving much impression on New Yorkers (the news cycle had also moved on by then). But within the Native American community, it felt like new bonds were formed and existing ones made stronger. 

I organized a talk at Hunter College and flew out Raymond Kingfisher, a Native American elder and activist. So suddenly here is a guy who sang happy birthday to Rosa Parks, and he's sharing my futon mattress with 3 other activists while I'm sleeping under my desk and my cat is confused about all the company. Somehow the talk draws Natives from across the northeast US, and for 2 months after I end up hosting a Native American family - father and teenage daughter - while they hold ceremonies and do bank divestment actions in New York. They'd been hitching their way across the country after the invasion in ND.
