The question comes up all the time: **_Would I trade my arms for wings_**<sup>1</sup>, if I could?

It'd be impossible to type this without arms, and especially the hands and fingers that accompany them. On the other hand, with (the right kind of) wings i'd have Flight - something I'm currently incapable of, and hard to truly imagine. 

It's a really tough question. The best answer I could come up with is that I'd like to keep my arms, but while developing the ability to _manipulate the quanta of subatomic energies surrounding my body to overcome gravity_ and lift myself to any height and distance - within the reasonable limits of my own stamina.

I realize that's cheating the question; it would be the best of [both](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) [worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics). You can't have your cake and eat it too<sup>2</sup>.

### notes

<sup>1</sup> This question has actually never come up.

<sup>2</sup> This is false; I received a cake (the kind with a hole in the center) as a seasonal gift from Noho Productions. It was _my cake_, and I ate the whole thing one cold afternoon when I didn't feel like going to the grocery store. It cost me nothing; it follows that _there does exist_ such a thing as a free lunch.
