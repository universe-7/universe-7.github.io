Hi Will

Thanks for taking a bit of time to help me figure out what might be best to submit to the Beasts of the City show. You'd think I'd be better prepared knowing this more than a month in advance. You'd think. I continue to tinker with my workflow, but every folder of images feels like an onslaught of potential edits. 

Anyways, images are in my head in a few categories:

- psychedelically out-of-focus or chaotic - mostly yellow-rumped warblers
- the American Kestrel - i've been following around since November
- actual beasts - e.g. this Red-Tailed hawk eating a pigeon
- actual pigeons - the root of the bird obsession
- overflow - things I forgot about but remembered when I opened a folder
