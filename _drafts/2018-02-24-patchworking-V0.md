It's cool to hear some of your story @mozz.

I toured the US for a 3 months last year, trying to make sense of what I consider to be a dysfunctional political left. 6 months later, I have renewed hope that political possibilities could open up around a new relationship between settlers and indigenous people. 

It's still just a theory, but I think a lot of the challenges the left faces, would be resolved by coming into closer relationship with indigenous ways of being, e.g. small- and large-scale solidarity, geographically localised decision-making that considers multi-generational timescales, the primacy of local sovereignty, healthy norms around social power, integrated physical/spiritual/environmental wellbeing etc.

However while I was in the US I felt like the intensity of trauma surrounding the history of slavery of Black folks, and the history of sexism against women and other marginalised genders, were both such enormous, space-filling issues, that almost nobody that I encountered even acknowledged the history of genocide that predates both of those traumas.

@richard wow - thanks for sharing your article. It's great to hear the Kiwi perspective on America at large; also great to know that there's common concerns. 

Been digesting the points you bring up the past couple of days. Your theory is one that I'd like to see spread

One thing that got me nodding excitedly, is your point about _shock as a tactic_. I feel like that's something I've observed with a lot of peers in NYC as theyve jumped from cause to cause almost in lockstep with whatever outrageous declaration is coming from Washington. I suppose thats also a news-cycle and tech-addiction problem; how these external forces exert control over our priorities and sense of time. I fully welcome the points of your theory; it feels like a lot of people have forgotten what happens locally around them, and get stuck in outrage at what amounts to an abstraction. 

The room to _safely fail_ is another thing I think about a lot. Beyond privatizing basic needs, I feel like there's this mentality in the general culture that doesn't accept failure - likely capitalist root. _I don't know_ becomes this horrible thing to say. Maybe except for Silicon Valley - where failure can be a mark of pride.

Following a Russian email investigation a year after an election has been decided...not sure if that's the best use of time. I fully welcome the points of your theory; it feels like a lot of people have forgotten what happens locally around them, and get stuck in outrage at what amounts to an abstraction.
