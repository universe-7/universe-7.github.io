_But who's gonna build the roads?_

I couldn't answer. _Who would build and maintain the roads,_ I thought to myself. I turned the conversation to interesting things happening in the #seasteading channel, and B's girlfriend T excitedly explained her research into using natural chemical reactions involving seawater to create new forms for her sculptures.

My impulse to point to seasteading got me thinking, maybe withdrawing from governed society seemed the only 'true' way to live out anarchist ideals. [James C. Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Not_Being_Governed) argues that the [Zomia](https://forwhattheywereweare.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/zomia-and-the-rivers-of-se-asia/) region of Southeast Asia isn't made up of an 'impoverished' bands of hill tribes - but rather they are deliberate communities who've resisted being governed in their rejection of the modern world.

I'm pretty naive still, despite some reading of [Anarchy, State, and Utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy,_State,_and_Utopia) by Robert Nozick and general articles on the [Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-anarchy-101). Simple and less-simple questions are both complex to answer for me at this point.

How much of everyday life is already ungoverned? Is there an analogue to Moore's law that applies to governed civilization? Is it impossible to imagine that the nation-state was only recently as powerful as it is? Can the networked world really diminish and eventually abolish the power of the nation-state as it currently is? _Who's gonna build the roads?_

Was the answer at the end of [Back to the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=874ZbBlO87w) all along?
