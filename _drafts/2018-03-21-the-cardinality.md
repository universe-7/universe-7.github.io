## if i were to pull five

- the flicker
- blue jay preen
- cardinal dive
- best titmouse (in focus)
- best titmouse (out of focus)

## notes from memory

- more cardinals than I could count
- blue jays remain elusive but caught one preening
- _tufted titmouse_ first sighting (!)
- young american goldfinches
- made it to the railroad tracks
- red-bellied woodpeckers were loud, matched sight to sound finally
- _northern flicker_ (!)
- diving chickadees
- dry-bag blizzard rig worked
- gonna guess they were song sparrows cuz there wasn't a swamp or a salt marsh
- a husky stopped me on the trail then her owner called her back. nice group of 4 folks walking their dogs. i said 'nice day, isn\'t it?' 'sure is - enjoy!'
- another husky ran up to me and i pet it. her owner said 'birdwatching?'. i said 'yea the snow makes everything so beautiful' her friend smiled and she and her lassie-dog walked past. saw 6 small songbirds fly overhead during this exchange.
- fresh snow on bare branches is very beautiful
- found the _actual_ waterhole
- not much traffic on the way back to studio
- focus variable depending on arm fatigue and amount of snow on lens
- let the rear defroster warm up before driving off
- grocery list: coconut oil or butter (bird suet), ground cumin (bean & cheese burrito)

### 01
- _tik_ _tik_ _chip_ _tschip_ cardinal calling card
- _"catbird vs. titmouse"_
- branch nibbling like an plumbing ostrich
- what are those branch nubs you nibble?
- landing on the most delicate branches a la li mu bai

### 02

- \*new\* downy slinking
- disconnected red-bellied branches
- cardinal pairs (MM, MF, MMM)
- chaos of branches
- mild snowblindness, judging from exposures on landscapes

### 03

- dece blue jays
- red-belly flight
- dark-eyed junco (!) at height of arm fatigue, hop, perch, take-wing, faster than fatigue
- dash of cardinals

### 04 

- hiding titmouse, behind a branch at limits of vision
- titmouse taking wing
- manual focus w/ fuzzy aim catches blue jay who was too quick to see
- tails love to exit frame
- lotta titmouse ass
- sojourn to the railroad tracks
- open-palmed branches present a leafy nest
- wet lens painterly possibilities
- cardinal & goldfinch branch buddies
- couple cardinal dudes 
- cardinal feeder flight
- wind
- cardinal & goldfinch branch buddies (perfect)
- face to face: red-bellied woodpecker
- goldfinch on the s-branch

- nothing is faster than a black-capped chickadee

### 06 

- lady cardinal libery spikes
- closest downy
- male on male cardinal
- goldfinch clarity


## nuclear mobbin w/ satellites

_Tufted Titmice and chickadees are ‘nuclear' species, often joined in winter flocks by a variety of ‘satellite' species. As a ‘nuclear' species, titmice influence the paths that flocks follow, are aggressive mobbers of potential predators, and often take the lead during mobbing events. The calls that titmice utter when mobbing provide information about the presence of predators for heterospecifics as well as conspecifics._

_gleaning (63%), hanging and gleaning (21%), hovering and gleaning (3%), probing (8%), pecking (2%), scratching and gleaning (1%), and turning leaves (1%)_
