## notes from memory

- he mumbled something about the camera as I photographed the starling (yellow beak) across the street near checkers
- attaining membership required 4 people, the main one called from the other side of the garden. pleasant nonetheless
- _the cocktails aren't free, but the members-only party is_
- the guard was nice and told me about the crane that sits on the red thing at the japanese garden. and the hawks. _we have plenty of birds here_
- holy shit its beautiful, damn where are the birds, im here at the wrong time of day, where can i smoke this cigarette, 
- the european lady ventured into the snow to ask me what kind of bird the robin was
- implemented in-depth post-shoot stretching
