## notes from memory

- he mumbled something about the camera as I photographed the starling (yellow beak) across the street near checkers
- attaining membership required 4 people, the main one called from the other side of the garden. pleasant nonetheless. grackle, two starlings in the tree above ticketing.
- small talked about how 4 visits would pay for the membership; he also told me that any festivals were also free. _nice_. **_the cocktails aren't free, but the members-only party is_** so even the cherry blossom festival is free? yes, and you can skip the line. the older woman apologized for how long the process took; I genuinely told her it was no problem. what kind of asshole gets angry about not being able to get into a botanical garden quickly enough?
- the guard was nice and told me about the crane that sits on the red thing at the japanese garden. and the hawks. **_we have plenty of birds here_**
- _holy shit its beautiful, damn where are the birds, im here at the wrong time of day, where can i smoke this cigarette, where did these people come from, holy shit a blue jay foraging, holy shit blue jays in the tree, holy shit too many blue jays_
- the european lady ventured into the snow to ask me what kind of bird the robin was. told her it was an american robin. she was really happy and thankful. 
- implemented in-depth post-shoot stretching and ate a bowl of yogurt and granola; will see if delayed onset muscle soreness develops.
