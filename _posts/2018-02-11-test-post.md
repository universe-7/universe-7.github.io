## Hi Kes

![vertical kestrel test](/images/012118-1337.jpg)

the internet loves a horizontal image - well, maybe mobile likes a vertical.

Kes was pretty active that day<sup>1</sup>. It was unseasonably warm and there hadn't been snow on the ground now for a few. The grasshoppers and other insects were probably more _present_, and he was catchin em actively up and down the field. He barely noticed I was following him (I think) - at one point even being startled after landing on a branch within 10 feet of me, not realizing how long I'd been standing there.

I just realized that **_'Koisuru Hakai'_** probably translates to _**'Loves Destruction'**_
