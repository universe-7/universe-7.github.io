<p class="message"> _Pete was crowned Mr. WHS, the all-male beauty pageant of Whitney High School, despite his current unshaven and, quite frankly, sloppy appearance. During this time, he dated the Class President, who drove them to Prom in her father's Mazda Miata. Previously, he earned a one-day suspension for an incident involving a potato projectile device._ - bio from the penultimate issue of Lucky Peach magazine</p>

## Jekyll-ing

Here's what a code snippet would look like (and also a reminder to myself to start on this historical weather vis project that's been on my mind for too long)
```
library(rwunderground)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

jfk <- set_location()
dec.2017 <- history_range(jfk, 
                          date_start = "20171201", 
                          date_end = "20171231",
                          limit = 10)
                          
str(dec.2017)   
```
